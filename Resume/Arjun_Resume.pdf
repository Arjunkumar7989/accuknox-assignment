PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

AI/ML Engineer with hands-on experience in Python-based data processing, machine learning, and LLM-powered systems. I have worked on real-world projects involving APIs, CSV data, SQLite databases, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. Comfortable making assumptions when requirements are open-ended and focusing on clean, readable, and practical implementations. Interested in building reliable, secure, and scalable AI-driven solutions.

Databases: SQLite, basic relational design

Data Handling: CSV, JSON, REST APIs

Visualization: Matplotlib

AI / ML: Classification, regression, model evaluation

GenAI & NLP: LLMs, RAG pipelines, embeddings, prompt engineering

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, Docker (basics)

EXPERIENCE
Generative AI Engineer

Telus Digital | Remote | Sep 2025 – Present

Built and maintained LLM-based automation tools using Python to support multiple internal workflows, reducing manual effort by approximately 40%.

Developed AI assistants for text summarization and query generation, validating outputs across 100+ test scenarios.

Performed structured prompt engineering and evaluation, improving response relevance and consistency.

Designed and implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using embeddings and semantic search over large document collections.

Data Science Intern

Codecraf Infotech | Remote | Mar 2024 – May 2024

Collected, cleaned, and processed 12,000+ records using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL.

Built and evaluated supervised ML models using Scikit-learn for internal use cases.

Conducted exploratory data analysis and feature selection to support data-driven decisions.

Created Power BI dashboards to track key business KPIs and improve reporting visibility.

PROJECTS
API Data Ingestion and SQLite Storage

Implemented Python scripts to retrieve data from REST APIs (with documented assumptions where APIs were unavailable).

Designed SQLite schemas and stored structured data programmatically.

Focused on clean code, error handling, and clear separation between data, database, and logic.

Enterprise Knowledge Assistant using RAG

Built a RAG-based system to answer queries from internal documents using embeddings and semantic retrieval.

Processed and chunked large document sets, generating embeddings for efficient vector search.

Integrated retrieval results with LLM generation to reduce hallucinations and improve answer quality.

Student Score Analysis and Visualization

Processed student score data and calculated aggregate metrics such as averages.

Visualized insights using Python and Matplotlib with a focus on clarity over complex design.
