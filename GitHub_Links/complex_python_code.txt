Description:
This project is my most complex Python-based implementation, where I designed and built an end-to-end
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. I handled data preprocessing, document chunking,
embedding generation, semantic retrieval, and LLM-based response generation. The project required
careful handling of assumptions, error cases, and prompt optimization to ensure reliable and
consistent outputs.
